## REACT - Create React App
Create React App (CRA) is a tool developed by Facebook that helps you quickly set up a new React project with no configuration needed. It includes a pre-configured build process, development server, and a set of pre-installed dependencies that allow you to start building a new React application immediately. CRA abstracts away the complexity of configuring a new React project, and provides a standardized starting point that can be customized to fit your needs.

## Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies the use of Redux by providing a set of utilities and tools that can help you write Redux code with less boilerplate and fewer errors. It includes features such as createSlice, which allows you to define reducers and actions in a more concise and easy-to-use way, and configureStore, which sets up your Redux store with sane defaults and automatically applies middleware such as Thunk and DevTools. With Redux Toolkit, you can write more efficient and maintainable Redux code with fewer lines of code and less boilerplate.

## Typescript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to improve the development experience, catch errors earlier, and make code more scalable and maintainable. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing developers to use it in any environment that supports JavaScript.

## Tailwind css
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles that can be used to rapidly build custom user interfaces. It includes a comprehensive set of CSS classes that cover a wide range of design requirements such as typography, layout, and color. With Tailwind CSS, you can quickly create custom designs without writing a lot of custom CSS code. It also provides the ability to customize and extend the framework to fit your project's needs. Tailwind CSS is a popular choice for developers who want to build modern and responsive user interfaces quickly and efficiently.
